Project name: Simple and effective Volunteer Management System

Description: The project is a prototype of how a proper volunteer management system should look like, based on our opinions. Take note that it is a prototype, which means only the core functions are available. However, additional functions that are deemed necessary can be added on top of the prototype. We feel that an effective and simple Volunteer Management System is a prerequisite for organizations such as Food Bank Singapore to properly plan out the schedules for volunteers to help out. Before we began, we went to take a look at the current Volunteer Management System of Food Bank Singapore over at their website. We realised that it is just a form and some crucial information such as days available and areas of interest could not be selected at all. Thus, with those missing information, we believe that the organization will be unable to plan out proper schedule to allow volunteers to come to help out. As we are creating our prototype, we made sure to keep the prototype simple and yet serving its purpose - which is to allow volunteers to book for a slot easily. This will ensure the prototyper caters to a large group of people as many will be able to use it.
